# VisionX

**VisionX** is an open-source project focused on helping blind or visually impaired people understand their surroundings using AI-driven vision and audio feedback.

The goal is to create a system that captures visual information, interprets it using computer vision, and then communicates it through sound or speech.

## Project Overview

VisionX combines three main components:

- **Audio Module** — handles sound input/output, voice triggers, and spoken feedback.  
- **Camera Module** — captures frames and streams for visual processing.  
- **Vision Module** — performs object detection and scene understanding.

Each component works together to provide a seamless assistive experience.
