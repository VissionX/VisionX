# Design Document

## Overview
VisionX is designed to help visually impaired users understand their surroundings using audio feedback generated from real-time visual analysis.

## User Experience (UX)
- The user interacts with the system through **voice commands**.
- The system responds **with voice output** describing the environment.
- The interface (if present) should be minimal and accessible.

## UI Design 
If we use a UI framework (we think on kivy for now):
- Two clicks to start processing.

> Still under process.
- Voice-based navigation.
- Simple layout focused on functionality.

## Future Plans
- Add vibration feedback for obstacles.
- Provide user customization options (voice type, response delay, etc).
